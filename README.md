# Photography-Portfolio-Website
School assignment, autumn 2019

A portfolio website coded with HTML, CSS and Jquery. Shows thumbnails of photographs, that can be clicked to show a bigger
version of it, together with a description. On the contact page there is a message form and a map API (OBS: key removed).
The website is responsive and has two different media queries, one for computer and one for mobile.
